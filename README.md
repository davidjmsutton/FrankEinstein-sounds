# FrankEinstein-sounds
This app is in Kotlin.
It uses an ML Image Labeler with a custom ML Tensorflowlite model taken from the Tensor flow web page (not made by us)
It allows an image from camera or an image from smart phone library to be loaded in
ML tool finds a single image label for the object in the image - this is treated as a variable
The user can then bring up through a local asset folder of html pages with pngs attached - a human generated idea on how to upcycle the object
OR
The user can use the internet to do a search for the object label plus the words upcyc
There are 2 other buttons, 1 opens an html page of instructions on how to use the app with with links to upcycling and shop, the other button goes to Youtube where they can see an animation of what the idea of upcycling is and how it can come about
There are sounds attached - we will NOT use sounds in the final version - this was a mistake
